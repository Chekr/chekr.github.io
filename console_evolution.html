<p>
Entering the third home video game console generation, Sega had enjoyed the arcade market for years. With Nintendo looking at trying their hand at the home console market with the upcomming <b>Family Computer</b> or <b>Famicom</b> (known as the <b>NES</b> or <b>Nintendo Entertinment</b> System overseas), Sega decided to release their own home console. On July 15th, 1983 Sega relased both the <b>SG-1000</b> and <b>SC-3000</b> on the same date as the Famicom. The system had similar specs, with the SC-3000 being designed a a "home computer" variant with an integrated keyboard. The system was only released in Japan and some parts of Oceania. An upgraded <b>SC-3000H</b> was released as well, being the same as the SC-3000 with the excecption of replacing the chicklet keyboard with full keys.

The system was quite similar to MSX standard of computers popular in Japan at the time with a Zilog Z80 CPU running at 3.58Mhz, 1KB RAM, and a Texas Instruments TMS8818A GPU, but swapping out the sound chip with a Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG (Programmable Sound Generator). The TMS chip offered a 256x192 screen resolution with 16 colors and 32 on-screen sprites.

Of note, to support the Home Computer aspect of the SC-3000, an optional expansion devices was released, the SF-7000, providing a 3" floppy drive, an additional 64KB RAM, an 8KB ROM, a Centronics parallel port, and an RS-232 port.

<p>
A variant system was released a year later on July 31, 1984, the <b>SG-1000 II</b>, also known as the "<b>Mark II</b>". The Mark II replaces the hardwired Controller 1 port with a DE-9 controller port, like Controller 2 port and both controller ports of the SC-3000. The system also integrated the Sega <b>My Card</b> system, to offer a cheaper, simpler replacement for the system cartridges. The Sega <b>Card Catcher</b> adapter was released as a cartridge-based adapter to allow the My Cards to be used in the older systems.
