Sound is represented by an acoustic wave. The larger these waves, or their [amplitude], the high the [volume] of the sound, and vise-versa. Volume is usually measures in [decibles](dB)

Sounds are also often identified by their [pitch], where the perception of a sound changes in accordance with how quickly it changes, most notably in the form of [frequency], or the number of repetitions over a period of time. This is usually measured in [hertz](Hz) or "number of repetitions per second". Take the following examples:

A 440Hz tone sounds like so:

[440hz_a.wav]

And can be represented one a graph like so:

[440hz_a_graph.txt]
